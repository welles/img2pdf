# IMG2PDF

This simple tool takes images and puts them in a PDF file. It can be used as a simple PNG/JPG-to-PDF converter or for combining multiple images, e.g. the output from a scanner that exports image files.

## Usage

Example: `impg2pdf.exe C:\Path\To\Image1.png C:\Path\To\Image2.jpg C:\Path\To\Output.pdf`

You can supply as many images as you wish, each image will be put on a separate page in the PDF in its original resolution.

The last parameter must be a path to a non-existing PDF file.
